### Last Updated for Dec 3, 2023. (KR's 1.0.* release, HoI4 1.13.*)

### As it's highly unlikely that the Reworked Air Designer mod will get updated to 1.14 anytime soon, I've officially abandoned working on a patch for this and instead integrated a few selected modules, like ASW equipment, into [KR Tech Extension](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3105210203), which is compatible with both KR and KX.

The homemade successor to the [official KR compatch](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2950634966) for [Reworked Air Designer](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2948174914) mod, mostly for my personal use.

This requires the vanilla version of the mod to run. This patch only overwrites history files and does not touch anything elseâ€”just enough to get both to work together again.

The compatibility between this mod and KX or the [Kaiserreich Naval Rework](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2862849828) submod is a bit janky - so use them at your own risk.
